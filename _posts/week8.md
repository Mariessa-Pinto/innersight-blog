This week, our team worked hard with our commercial, adding animations to our app, and made great progress with coding the application.

We presented our first sprint of four this week to Henry, which was debugging our sentiment analysis and routing the AI through designated buttons. This allows the AI sentiment to analyze when the user presses the AI button featured on our application in the toolbar. 

The team's objectives for this week was as follows:

## Design
### Complete animations for application, including logo animations, demo page animations, mascot animations, and background animations
- Led by Glenda, Kyle and Lauryn
- Glenda to complete logo and demo page animations 
- Lauryn to complete mascot animations
- Kyle to complete background animations
### Draft investor landing page
- Designed by Lauryn 
### Stylize this blog
- Led by Glenda and Patricia
### Add animations to Visual Story commercial
- Lauryn and Kyle to use After Effects to help with animating the panda in certain scenes and adding message pop ups

## Development
### Code functionality and debugging 
- Mariessa, Patricia and Anika are all the main developers for functionality
### Customer landing page

### Continue with the sentiment analysis

Our application is surely coming along, and we're so excited to show you the final product within the next few weeks!
