The InnerSight team continue to march on with development as they approach presentation day. Over the following week, the Innersight team has been working hard to make finishing touches and details to the project deliverables and application. 

## Marketing Materials
On November 24th, two members of the Innersight design team actively participated in the productions at GCOM. During this event, the team arranged the printing of copies for their brochures and business cards. Furthermore, in an exciting development, the team successfully created their third marketable deliverable: stickers! These stickers are scheduled for distribution at the upcoming presentation to VIPs.

Furthermore, following the completion of the concept designs for our marketing pages last week, we have made significant progress. We successfully finished coding InnerSight's Landing and Investor's pages. Additionally, the Innersight commercial has completed its post-production phase.

## UX
In focusing on the UX aspect, the team conducted a thorough review, making necessary final adjustments to both the Innersight brochure and business cards before finalizing them for printing. Moreover, the team expanded their efforts by creating two supplementary mascot graphics, integrating them into the third marketable deliverable.

## Coding
In terms of coding, the team remains dedicated to implementing new functions into the app through ongoing sprints. This week, the primary focus lies in enhancing security measures, addressing any existing bugs, and refining the overall UI flow of the application.

Thank you for tuning in, and please stay tuned for next week's update as Innersight steadily progresses towards its launch date!
