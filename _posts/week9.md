Development for innersight is in full swing as the team continues to produce deliverable after deliverable. Over the week, the team of innersight worked on various tasks creating marketing materials and coding functionality for the application. 

## Marketing Materials
A variety of marketing materials is being created for innersight in order to promote the app and to communicate the app’s value to potential users. Printed materials for innersight are:
Print brochure
Print stickers
Print business cards
On Friday November 24th, 2023, a team member will visit the GCOMM building at BCIT to develop the distributable versions of the print materials.

Digital content is also key to marketing innersight. Digital content includes:
Video advertisement using a storytelling concept
Digital marketing landing page
Digital investor landing page
Designers worked to develop animations for the video advertisement while coders worked on bringing landing page prototypes to live through NextJS React framework.

## UX
Research and UX testing is an important activity to run throughout the entire app production process. This informs us of how users actually interact with the app using evidence. This week, UX testing was conducted on the save journals functionality and the AI sentiment to ensure that the functions were working as intended. 

## Coding
Team members are working hard to develop the most valuable function of the app– the AI sentiment analysis. The AI is able to read journal entries and return an analysis, and so coders this week worked on saving journals in a database, along with getting keywords within a journal entry counted so that they could be saved. 

That’s all for now! As we draw closer to innersight’s launch, the team gets more and more excited to share it with you. See you next time!
