What a whirlwind of a week as InnerSight ramps up design production! Over the week, the team of InnerSight worked on various tasks to refine the app UI and UX design. 

A preliminary user survey on journaling experiences was developed, distributed, analyzed, and written up in a report. Secondary research from a mental health forum was also collected. This report helped the team to better understand experiences, motivations, and pain points of users journaling or wanting to journal. Based on this user data, we created a data-driven recommendation that the following components to be implemented on the app:

- Reminders/notifications: Reminding the user of when to write in their journal.
- Prompts: Auto-generated phrases to help users start writing. 
- Privacy Policy: Displaying the app’s policies regarding AI use and data privacy.
- Customization: Ability to customize app aesthetics.
- Statistics and Progress: Displaying statistics based on a user’s journal content.
- Music component: Ability to play music while on the app.
- Resources: Integrating resources for the user to read/watch/learn and be easily accessible.
- Drawing pad/Imagery: Ability to draw or add images to journal entries. 


At the same time as the user survey was released, the InnerSight team conducted a competitive analysis of direct competitor apps. Journaling apps Daylio, DailyBean, Calm, Reflectly, Penzu, Evolve, and Reflection were included in this analysis. The competitive analysis allowed the team to inspect important features in each app, and investigate how each feature added or detracted from the user’s experience. A list of actionable items was created for each app to help inform developers of pitfalls in other apps– and how to avoid them. 

On September 26th the team consulted with Henry Leung regarding InnerSight app design progress. The first drafts of the app mockups were discussed. The team’s actionable takeaway was to revise the mockups by focusing on the core value of the app which is providing AI-generated feedback to users based on their written journal content. The team also internally reviewed each of the three preliminary mockups and identified strengths and weaknesses in each design. We made the decision that goal-based features would be removed from the app (e.g., writing streaks, challenges, writing goals) because it would cause too much stress/pressure for the user.

In the week ahead the team divided the following tasks to accomplish: 

## UX/UI Design
