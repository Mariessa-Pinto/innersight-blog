This week, we established the full scope of our project idea! 

After our first consultation with Henry on September 15, each group member was tasked with journaling for a few days to identify any pain points in traditional journaling methods. Some of our members journaled in the morning, some in the evening, and some for venting purposes.

On September 20, 2023, our group met in person for the first time. We all introduced ourselves to each other and followed a concise meeting agenda drafted by our project managers. As we had set an internal deadline to complete the aforementioned journaling task by September 19, we were able to discuss our findings with each other and identify different features that would benefit our app's users.

We also determined where our blog would be hosted and how we would divide the blog posts. Additionally, we reviewed our team charter, which was collectively completed the previous week, and determined that it was ready for submission. Next, we discussed how to divide the work for our upcoming user research and competitive analysis assignments. 

We reconvened with Henry for our second consultation meeting on September 22, 2023, where we discussed the challenges we encountered during our journaling task. Henry provided guidance to us in determining the value of our app. In summary, our group found that InnerSight would be highly valuable in helping potential users analyze trends in their emotions within their journal entries. From this point onward, the designers were tasked with drafting some low-fidelity mockups of our app. Features that we determined must be included in the app are text-to-speech functionality, journal space with options for generated/custom prompts, goal setting, mood tracking, AI-generated stats, crisis support, and interface customization.

We are so excited to see what our app will look like, and how it will benefit our target audience!
